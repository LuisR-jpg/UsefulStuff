I created this document after finishing my second internship to get a better and faster feel of the team, maximize communication and clarity and leverage my team.

Follow these tips and try to answer the following questions:

*Onboarding stage*

- 1-1 with all the team. It's good so you get to know the ppl you'll be working with; also you an idea of who to reach out to for help.

- Good practices?

- Who helps with technical stuff? Who with career related stuff?

*Design stage*

- Current architecture of the project?


- See my team's PRs

- Make sure you fully understand the project. How flexible does this project have to be?

*Coding stage*

- Workflow for commits?

- Share progress through draft prs.

- Keep your PRs as small as possible

*Final presentation* 

- Present with enthusiasm, tell them why they need your protect. SELL YOUR PROJECT

- Present standing (being seated makes it less dynamic)
